# Modeling Conviction Voting 
Repository for modeling Conviction Voting. In our main model, Conviction3, we bake in an Augmented Bonding Curve and simulate how the economy reacts to different parameterizations of the Conviction Voting component.

The most up-to-date version is in our google collab file here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LFhOawHAHxigpeG4wXj2kIW5UJNXPNAa

Our plan for developing this into a web based easy to play with tool is here:
